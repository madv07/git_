Migrate virtual machines from one vCenter to another vCentre
1. ESXI version must be 6.0 or later
2. vsphere client must be in Enhanced link mode
3. Both Vcenter center must be in time sync for sso token
4. shared storage


change compute resource(host migration)
change resource(smotion)
change both compute and storage
cross vCenter server export

	Enter Vcenter FQDN	
	Credentials
	select ESXI	
	STORAGE
	destination network
	

==========================================================
virtualization is a process of creating s/w based computers(vm)
To create virtualization, a piece of s/w called hypervisor
ESXI is the hypervisor bare metal that directly runs on Physical server w/o OS 
multiple ESXI can be managed by vcenetr server& vcenter can be accessed by vsphere client 

=======================================================

ESXI host troubleshooting

1. gather info about the esxi
2. check if the issue is in Single ESXI or multiple
3. Review the H/w
4. hardware monitoring tools like SolarWinds
5. review logs(kernel logs, hostd logs, syslog and other logs /var/log directory
look for an error messages
6. restart mgmt services( /etc/init.d/hostd restart
7. patch or update(
8. vendor support

============================================================
host profile (it will help u capture the settings of ESXi host)
	cluster--> right click--> configure--> host profile

login into the esxi host

==================================================

add host to vcenter and create cluster

select the datacenter( create DC if u don't have any)
right click DC --> add host
